## Start the app (with Sandbox)

- run `npm run start` command
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/

## Start the app (with Mock Server)

- Open `apps/backbase-react/src/environments/environment.ts` file and update `skipLogin: false` to `skipLogin: true`
- run `npm run run:mocks` command
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/


## Running the app in web-base

- Open `apps/backbase-react/src/environments/environment.ts` file and set `skipLogin: false`
- run `npm run mock-server` command
- run `npm run run:docker` command
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/

## Generate Open API Spec using Typescript-RxJS

- run `openapi-generator-cli generate -i api.yaml -g typescript-rxjs -o ./tmp` command

## Additional Help

- If you face any issues while running the docker, run `colima stop` and `colima start` command. If previous commands does not solve the issue, run `colima delete` and `colima start` command.
- If process is already running on 4200 or 9999 port, run `lsof -i :9999` or `lsof i :4200` command, copy PID from output and run `kill -9 <<PID>>` command. Replace `<<PID>>` with actual PID.
